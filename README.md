BLACK AND WHITE PIXEL ART CANVAS

This program creates a simple black and white pixel art canvas using basic HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
You can click on each pixel to toggle its background color between black and white, allowing to create cute patterns.

GETTING STARTED

To use this program, simply clone this repository and open the "pixel.html" file in your web browser.
You should see a grid of white pixels. Click on any pixel to change its color to black, or click again to change it back ot white.

CUSTOMIZATION
you can customize the program in various ways,such as changing the size of the pixel grid or adding new features.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I implemented this program inspired by the figma design of a pixel art canvas created by the youtube channel named "sketch together".
Since this is my first program created entirely from scratch using my every ounce of knowledge in js,css and html, It may not be the complex program out there, and do contain flaws, will develop this in to a better project in the future.
Thank you.
